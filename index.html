    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Ryan Chindavong and I have lived in
      Washington State my whole life. I attended the
      University of Washington as an undergrad and am
      excited to be back to pursue this HTML, CSS3, and
      Responsive Design for Web Development Certificate.

    <h1>Why am I taking this class?</h1>
    <p>
      I want to learn more about web development. I think it's
      an important skill to have in this day and age. This
      field is new to me but I'm enjoying the class so far!
      Hopefully the skills I learn will benefit my future career.
      I look forward to the remainder of the course!
